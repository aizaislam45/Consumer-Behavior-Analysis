# Instacart Consumer Behavior Analysis

Delve into a robust analytics pipeline designed to transform Instacart‚Äôs 2017 grocery order data into actionable intelligence. This project combines scalable data engineering, interactive exploration, sophisticated customer segmentation, predictive modeling, and market basket analysis to drive improved customer engagement and optimized inventory strategies.

## üéØ Project Goals

* *Customer Insight:* Understand purchasing rhythms and customer lifetime value through RFM analysis and clustering.
* *Personalized Recommendations:* Build models that anticipate the next item a shopper will add, boosting basket size.
* *Product Association:* Reveal high-confidence item pairings with Apriori, FP-Growth, and a novel PageRank on item co-occurrence graphs.
* *Operational Efficiency:* Offer inventory managers visibility into demand cycles (hourly, daily, seasonal) for smarter stocking.

## üîç Key Components

* *Big Data Processing:* Leverage Hadoop (MapReduce) for handling millions of records, with Python scripts for feature engineering (recency, frequency, time-of-day).
* *Exploratory Analysis:* Jupyter notebooks packed with interactive visualizations tracking order volume, basket size, and temporal trends.
* *Segmentation & Scoring:* Calculate RFM metrics and apply K-Means clustering to segment customers into actionable groups.
* *Predictive Pipeline:* Train and validate gradient boosting and neural network models using cross-validation to achieve \~75% next-item prediction accuracy.
* *Graph-Based Insights:* Implement PageRank on the product co-occurrence network to identify top-traffic items beyond simple frequency counts.

## üöÄ Why This Stands Out

1. *End-to-End Scalability:* From Hadoop-driven ETL on raw CSVs to lightweight Python modeling, the pipeline scales with data size.
2. *Novel Graph Approach:* Applying PageRank to uncover influential products provides deeper insights than traditional frequency-based methods.
3. *Action-Oriented Deliverables:* Segments, predictions, and association rules come with clear business use cases‚Äîmarketing campaigns, personalized recommendations, and inventory planning.
4. *Reproducibility & Modularity:* Parameterized scripts and well-documented notebooks ensure seamless handoff and easy extension to new datasets or domains.
